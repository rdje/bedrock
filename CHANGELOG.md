# CHANGELOG.md

## bedrock-scaffold 0.2.0 — README Stability Policy + a layer-A byte cap

`BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.1`. Transferred from the reference deployment by maintainer order.

- **Added `README_POLICY.md`** (project-neutral, verbatim) — keeps `README.md` a stable landing
  page instead of a changelog/roadmap/catalogue, and states the caps rule.
- **Added the `README-STABILITY` doctrine** (`scripts/check_readme_stability.sh`): a line cap
  AND a byte cap, a dated-line (release-history) tripwire, and a required link back to the
  policy. Non-mutating; REFUSES (exit 2) rather than passing when the README or policy is
  absent. Template defaults 300 lines / 16384 bytes — generous on purpose, because they ship to
  a project whose README is not this one; tighten after your own trim.
- ⛔ **Closed a bypass the spine was itself shipping.** `scripts/check_memory_architecture.sh`
  capped layer-A `MEMORY.md` by LINES only (cap 120, no byte bound), exactly as
  `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` §9's reference check prescribed — so **every adopting project
  inherited a bound that does not bind.** Measured on a real project running this spine:
  60 lines (passing, exactly at its cap) carrying **138,403 bytes** — 2,306 B/line, one line of
  18,816 B. Now both caps, in the check **and** in the standard (§6 / §9 / §9.1).
  Layer-A caps: **50 lines** (tightened from 120, to match the "≤ ~50 lines" §6 already stated)
  and **7168 bytes**. Both env-overridable.
- Both new files added to the `update_scaffold.sh` NEUTRAL allow-list, so existing projects
  pull them with `scripts/update_scaffold.sh <bedrock-url>`.
- Verified: `make gate` 6/6 green; a 13-line / 19,304-byte fixture is REJECTED by the byte cap
  while being well under the line cap; the **retired** layer-A guard PASSES that same file
  (exit 0) — the change is proven necessary by execution, not by argument.

Changelog-style summary of completed work + its validation (internal continuity surface;
the immutable audit trail proper is `git log` — memory layer D). Newest first.

## _(YYYY-MM-DD)_ — bootstrap

Instantiated from the `bedrock` discipline-spine template. Next: replace `ROADMAP.md` and
seed the first task-tree.
