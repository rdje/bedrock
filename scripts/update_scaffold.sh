#
#   scripts/update_scaffold.sh <bedrock-repo-url-or-local-path>
#
# ⛔⛔ THIS TOOL NEVER OVERWRITES. It used to, and that was wrong — measured, not feared.
#
# The premise was that the files below "never carry project content". Across the three
# projects created from this template, that premise is FALSE for most of them:
# `docs/TASK_TREE.md` diverges by 20-30 lines (it indexes the project's OWN trees),
# `TOOLBOX.md` by 27-616, `check_task_acceptance.sh` by up to 447, `check_readme_stability.sh`
# by 217. A "pull the latest spine" run silently replaced a mature project's hardened checks
# with the template's simpler ones, and `make gate` PASSED afterwards — because template
# files satisfy template checks, so the advertised safety net cannot see this class at all.
#
# It happened: 2026-09-21, a run in one project wiped its task-tree index (11 registered
# trees), its four own doctrine rows, its tool registry and its tiered commit workflow. It was
# recoverable only because nothing had been committed yet.
#
# ⭐ AND THE IMPROVEMENT OFTEN FLOWS THE OTHER WAY. `MAINTAINING.md` records that transfer
# runs BOTH ways: a mature project hardens a check and sends it back here. Overwriting that
# project from here is backwards.
#
# So: identical → nothing. Absent → seeded. Different → the incoming version is written
# into `.bedrock-incoming/<path>` and reported, and you merge deliberately. Nothing you have
# is ever modified, renamed or deleted.
# Everything else project-owned
# (CLAUDE.md, README.md, ROADMAP.md, the live-docs, the project doctrine slot, the curated
# subsystems.md, and all of docs/tasks/ + docs/decisions/ records) is deliberately left
# alone. After syncing: review `git diff`, run `make gate`, and commit.

# ⛔ SEEDED ONCE, NEVER OVERWRITTEN — a spine file that carries a PROJECT DECISION.
#
# `NEUTRAL` above is blind-overwrite, which is correct for a file that never holds project
# content. A file that a project is MEANT to edit cannot be in it: re-syncing would silently
# revert that project's decision, and the more deliberate the decision, the worse the loss.
#
# But such a file still has to REACH a project that predates it, or a new spine rule lands
# only in projects created afterwards — which is exactly the gap this category was added to
# close (`BEDROCK-MAINTENANCE.2.9` follow-up): `VISIBILITY.md` carries a declared posture a
# project may change, so it is copied when ABSENT and left alone when present.
