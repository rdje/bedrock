## _(2026-09-04)_ — a green gate that judges nothing is the class a template must not ship

- Two of the four doctrine ports in `.2.6` were wrong on first run and their own RED self-test arms said so:
  a `python3 - <<'PY'` detector whose stdin was the heredoc (every arm read 0 rows), and a `grep -c … | grep -qx 0`
  control under `pipefail` (`grep -c` prints 0 and exits 1). A self-test with only GREEN arms would have passed both.
- The neutrality bar is measured, not felt: `grep -ciE 'grammar|parser|…'` over each ported script → 0, after the
  generic uses of "corpus" and "grammar" were re-worded ("tree", "syntax") so the count means what it says.

Detailed technical notes — root cause, implementation, validation — per slice. The
engineering-continuity surface (not the public docs; that's `docs/book/`). Newest first.

## _(YYYY-MM-DD)_ — bootstrap

Repo created from the `bedrock` template: durable 4-layer memory, task-tree tracking, the
strict commit workflow, and the mechanical doctrine enforcer are in place and enforced by
git hooks + CI. No project code yet.
